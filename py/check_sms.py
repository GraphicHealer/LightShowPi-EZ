    When executed, this script will check all the SMS messages from a Google Voice account checking
    for either the "help" command, which will cause a help message to be sent back to the original
    sender, or a single number indicating which song they are voting for.

    When a song is voted for, the playlist file will be updated with the sender's cell phone number
    to indicate it has received a vote from that caller.  This also enforces only a single vote per
    phone number per s (until that song is played).

    See the commands.py file for other commands that are also supported (as well as instructions on
    adding new own commands).

    Sample usage:

    sudo python3 check_sms.py --playlist=/home/pi/music/.playlist

    sudo python3 check_sms.py --setup=True
