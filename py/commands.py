# Initial commands implemented by Chris Usey (chris.usey@gmail.com)
"""Command definition file.

Enabled commands must be defined in the configuration file. Each command must also have a
matching function defined in this file with a name in the form 'def cmd_command_name(user, args)'.
For example, the command help would have a matching function definition for 'def cmd_help(user,
args)'. The user argument will include the cell number of the user who made the request (if the
command is received via sms) and the 'args' argument is a string containing all the text in the
command sent (e.g. an sms message) after the command name itself has already been stripped.
So following the 'help' example, if a user with the cell phone number 1 (123) 456-7890 texted
'help me please!!!' then the function cmd_help will be called with arguments user = '+11234567890:',
and args = ' me please!!!'.

The function should return a string that will then be sent back to the user in some fashion (e.g.
in a return text message if via sms). Return an empty string if you'd rather no message be sent in
response to the command.

To install the command, simply instantiate an instance of Command for the command you've created
(see examples below). Note that new commands may be defined in their own files if desired (i.e. no
need to define all commands in this file).
