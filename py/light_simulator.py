"""Simple Gui to see what the lightshow is doing

The is a development tool made so that you do not need to keep setting up your
RPI with a breadboard and leds.  It allows you to edit and run the code right
on you linux desktop.

Setup:
      You will need to install the dependencies for lightshowpi on you computer
      look at the install scripts to see what is needed.
      
Usage:
      Open 2 terminals, in both export your SYNCHRONIZED_LIGHTS_HOME variable
      or you can export it globally and not do this all the time.  But if your
      working with different versions in different directories you might not want
      to do that.  Next edit (or create)overrides.cfg and under [network] set 
      networking = server In one of the terminals start this sim.  You will not
      see anything yet.  In the second terminal start synchronized_lights.py as
      a regular user without sudo (you don't need access to the gpio pins) so
      you don't need to run as root
      
      When the show starts a Tkinter window will open up and you can see what
      lightshowpi is doing.  Just leave the Tkinter window running.  Every time
      you run synchronized_lights it will respond.
      
Note:
      Also note if you do globally set SYNCHRONIZED_LIGHTS_HOME the scripts in
      the bin folder should also work with this as well as the sms code if you 
      set everything up correctly.

      Audio-in might be a problem on some distros.  For example the audioop module
      is not part of my version of openSuse.  But it is in Debian and Ubuntu so
      it will work with them.
