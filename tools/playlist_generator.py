# Playlist generator for LightshowPi
# Author: Eric Higdon (mrbassman.10@gmail.com)
#
# How To:
# cd to the location of the playlist script (i.e. "lightshowpi/tools/generatePlaylist")
# run "python3 generatePlaylist.py"
# Enter the path to the folder of songs which you desire a playlist for then press <enter> (i.e.
# "/home/pi/lightshowpi/music/sample")
# Playlist file will be created in the folder
# Paths are absolute. Include the whole path to the songs folder. (i.e.
# "/home/pi/lightshowpi/music/christmas")

#
# Updated: Tom Enos
# added support to pull title from metadata if it exists
# added support for multiply file types
#
