pifm - https://github.com/rm-hull/pifm

pi_fm_rds - https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds

Note that pi_fm_rds has been modified for lightshowpi to accept a sample rate
and number of channels for piped input (stdin), as previous behavior is to
use a raw pcm (wav) header to determine these values
