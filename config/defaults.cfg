# A NOTE ON PORT EXPANDERS 
# If you are using a port expander and enable them in the following settings
# you must enable i2c and/or spi modules on the raspberryPi. 
# you can check to see if these modules are enabled by issuing the command:
# $ sudo lsmod
# In the output you will find the following if i2c and/or spi is enabled
# > spi_bcm2708             4808  0 
# > i2c_bcm2708             4719  0 
# A simple Google search will provide instruction on enabling I2C and SPI modules 
# on the RaspberryPi

# Set the mode the pins should be configured in, namely "pwm" for fading in and

# effect when crossing a median frequency response per channel.
#
# Note: Mechanical relays will likely fail much sooner in "pwm" mode, it is 
# suggested to only use pwm mode if using solid state relays (SSR).
#
# You can configure each pin individually, for example:
#pin_modes = onoff,onoff,pwm,pwm,pwm,onoff,onoff
#
# Or you can simply set all pins to the same mode:

# We use the wiringPi's software pwm library for "pwm" fading:
#
# https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/software-pwm-library/
#
# TODO(todd giles): Add a page to the wiki with examples of different types of lights and
# relays and the effect produced for various PWM ranges.  The text below should be taken
# with a grain of salt as I have not been able to test as completely as I'd like to yet.
#
# Change the pwm range used for this software pwm by changing this setting.  The optimal 
# setting really depends on your hardware setup.  If you are using zero-cross relays and 
# driving an AC load then using a pwm range of 500 gives decent results (flickering
# effect for many led lights with input rectifiers, and a decent fade for incandescents).
# A range of 500 generates a 20Hz pwm frequency.
#
# If you have random cross relays that can shut-off / on at any time then going for a
# 60 Hz pwm frequency can be advantageous, although timing this to the actual zero crossings
# of the power line used will give the best fading effect - again with incandescent bulbs.
# A range of 167 approximately generates a 60Hz pwm frequency.
#
# If you are attempting to fade a DC led load then the default range of 100 which gives a
# 100Hz pwm frequency works fine.

# corresponding gpio_pins. When the frequencies are mapped without using
# custom_channel_mapping, and with a channel mapping defined as:
#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
# the lowest frequency is assigned to channel 1, the next highest to channel
# 2, and so on until the highest value is mapped to channel 8 (the 8th pin

# Now say you wanted your THIRD channel to have the lowest frequency, without
# using custom_channel_mapping you would have to physically rewire channel 3.
# With custom channel mapping you simply define:
#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,1,4,5,6,7,8
# Now both channel 1 and channel 3 will activated when the lowest frequency is
# played. custom_channel_mapping must be the same size as gpio_pins.

#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1
# With custom channel mapping the program will only calculate and distribute
# frequencies for the highest channel listed in custom_channel_mapping. So in

[network]
#network streaming
# The default mode for network streaming is be turned "off".
# For your pi to broadcast or receive you must set one pi in your network to
# be the server and any number to be clients
# options off, server, client
networking = off

# default port is 8888
# you can set this to any port of your choosing, just make sure that it
# does not interfere with other systems that might be on your network
# If you do change the default, you must change it on all systems that
# you have setup, the server pi and any client pi
port = 8888

# The buffer option determines the length of your receive buffer
# if the buffer is to small you will receive pickle errors (data is pickled
# before sending) if the buffer is to large it can cause your show to go out of
# sync.  The default is 1024 and is large enough for 16 channels.  If you add
# more channels you will need to increase this value.  It is best to use a 
# multiple of 8
buffer = 1024

# Channels
# Affects clients only
#
# The clients default default behavior is for a client to mirror the lightshow
# with all available channels available to the client. This also assumes the 
# server and the client have at the least the same number of channels defined.
# The server can have more channels defined, but the client cannot, at least 
# for this default configuration to work.
#
# You can have more channels on the client but you must index them to one of the
# existing channels being broadcast by the server.
# Example
# channels = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
# 
# The channels option is index based and starts at 0, this means that the pin numbers
# in the gpio_pins options does not matter, only the index number does.
# It starts at 0 and will increase by one for each channel.
# 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,etc..........
#
# You can omit channels and even duplicate channels.
# Examples

# If a server has 32 channels it will broadcast the data for all 32 channels,
# but if a client only has 8 channels it will only playback the data for the first
# 8 channels, also clients can not playback data for more channels then the server
# can supply so having a client with 16 channels and a server with only 8 is not very
# useful in a simple mirroring setup.
# Use this setting to tell your client which channels to use
# channels are list based and start at 0
# 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 = 8 channels
# 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 = 16 channels
#
# These channels must be defined on you server, but do not need to be real channels
# You can simply add virtual channels to your server by adding to gpio_pins option
# in the "[hardware]" section.
# Define your real channels first, then add any number of virtual channels that you
# want after that
# example
# you have 8 real channels on your server, and add 8 virtual channels to display
# on your client
# on the server do this
# gpio_pins = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107
# just pick unused pin numbers, 100 seems like a good place to start as pins
# above 100 do not exist, you can use any starting point you wish, but I recommend
# following the guidelines for using expander chips as a starting point
# After that you can send the virtual channels to your client and they will be displayed
#
# These channels will be mapped to the channels on the client
# in order, starting with the first available channel on the client
# The incoming channels from the server wil be mapped as you list them
#
# One last option is to not use a channel on the client
# just insert a negative number as the input channel and it will no
# longer be used.  Use any number less then 0 (negative)
# in this example channels 2 4 and 6 on the client will not be used
# channels = 0,1,-2,3,-4,5,-6,7

[terminal]
# This boolean if set to True will disable sending brightness values to your hardware,

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)
# This allows you to shake out the audio to brightness pipeline without having to hang
# your hardware off the pi.
# Launch synchonized_lights.py with the same command line as you normally would, and the
# active terminal will be used to render.
# The curses instance is launched in a way that ensures any runtime errors or tracebacks
# are still dumped on return to the normal command line.
