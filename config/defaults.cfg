# A user can define certain IC's to use with their project. A list of supported IC's
# are listed below along with their required parameters. You can define multiple IC's
# of the same type if you are chaining IC's or you can define multiple different types
# of IC's.  Some sample configurations can be found in the "config/contrib" directory.
# The support for these IC follow closely to extension supported by the wiringpi library.

#
# A NOTE ON PORT EXPANDERS 
# If you are using a port expander and enable them in the following settings
# you must enable i2c and/or spi modules on the raspberryPi. 
# you can check to see if these modules are enabled by issuing the command:
# $ sudo lsmod
# In the output you will find the following if i2c and/or spi is enabled
# > spi_bcm2708             4808  0 
# > i2c_bcm2708             4719  0 
# A simple Google search will provide instruction on enabling I2C and SPI modules 
# on the RaspberryPi
#

#
# You can configure each pin individually, for example:
#pin_modes = onoff,onoff,pwm,pwm,pwm,onoff,onff
#
# Or you can simply set all pins to the same mode:

# We use the wiringPi's software pwm library for "pwm" fading:
#
# https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/software-pwm-library/
#
# TODO(toddgiles): Add a page to the wiki with examples of different types of lights and
# relays and the effect produced for various PWM ranges.  The text below should be taken
# with a grain of salt as I have not been able to test as completely as I'd like to yet.
#
# Change the pwm range used for this software pwm by changing this setting.  The optimal 
# setting really depends on your hardware setup.  If you are using zero-cross relays and 
# driving an AC load then using a pwm range of 500 gives decent results (flickering
# effect for many led lights with input rectifiers, and a decent fade for incandescents).
# A range of 500 generates a 20Hz pwm frequency.
#
# If you have random cross relays that can shut-off / on at any time then going for a
# 60 Hz pwm frequency can be advantageous, although timing this to the actual zero crossings
# of the power line used will give the best fading effect - again with incandescent bulbs.
# A range of 167 approximately generates a 60Hz pwm frequency.
#
# If you are attempting to fade a DC led load then the default range of 100 which gives a
# 100Hz pwm frequency works fine.

# otherwise will result in output through the lineout port
#frequency is the fm channel to play on
#fm=true
#frequency=100.1

# Note: You may have to delete the song cache after changing these settings.

# The following values control the frequencies to which the channels will
# respond. With min_frequency being the lowest frequency for which a channel
# will be activated and max_frequency being the max frequency for which a 
# channel will be activated.
#
# The frequency range will be evenly divided beween all the channels defined
# in gpio_pins. 
#
# Note that custom_channel_frequencies overrides these settings.
min_frequency = 20
max_frequency = 15000

# The following setting can be used to custom map the channels, in effect
# this can programatically allow you to switch a specific channel of
# lights to a different frequency without having to physically rewire the
# channels.
#
# For example: Imagine we have 8 channel's output that are connected to
# corresponding gpio_pins. When the frequencies are mapped without using
# custom_channel_mapping, and with a channel mapping defined as:
#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
# the lowest frequency is assigned to channel 1, the next highest to channel
# 2, and so on until the highest value is mapped to channel 8 (the 8th pin
# defined in gpio_pins).
#
# Now say you wanted your THIRD channel to have the lowest frequency, without
# using custom_channel_mapping you would have to physically rewire channel 3.
# With custom channel mapping you simply define:
#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,1,4,5,6,7,8
# Now both channel 1 and channel 3 will activated when the lowest frequency is
# played. custom_channel_mapping must be the same size as gpio_pins.
#
# If you want to create a mirroring effect for the lights define:
#custom_channel_mapping = 1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1
# With custom channel mapping the program will only calculate and distribute
# frequencies for the highest channel listed in custom_channel_mapping. So in
# this mirroring example, the program will evenly distribute the frequencies.
#
# The default is not to define custom channel mapping and let the program
# map the channels 1:1
# custom_channel_mapping = 



# Defining custom_channel_frequencies overrides the min_frequency and
# max_frequency settings, allowing you to define a custom list of frequencies
# that should be utilized for each channel. The list must be the size of
# (gpio_pins + 1) or if custom_channel_mapping is being used it must be the
# size of the max value + 1 in the custom_channel_mapping list.
