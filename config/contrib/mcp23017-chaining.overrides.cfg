# SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE
# -------------------------
# This is a SAMPLE configuration file for the program. This file follows conventions
# of a python config file. The variables defined below control variable aspects
# of the program. To use this sample file, copy it to the config directory and rename
# the file "overrides.cfg".  This sample file only contains settings related to making
# specific functions or hardware work that are outlined in the description below. You can
# make changes to other settings by modifing the "config/defaults.cfg" file, or by adding
# them directly to this file.  NOTE: Full descriptions for each setting below can be found in
# the "config/defaults.cfg" file.

# -- Model B AND mcp23017 Sample Config File --
# ----------------------------------------------
# This sample config file can be used as a starting point for configuring your
# RaspberryPi Model B with two mcp23017 chained together. Each port expander will add an
# additional 16 GPIO to your project. This sample configures the RaspberryPi to use 8 GPIO 
# of the RaspberryPi Model B and an additional 32 GPIO from two mcp23017 Port expanders 
# for a total of 40 channels.

# mcp23017 Chip Addressing
# The following details how you might wire up a mcp23017 port expander to the raspberry Pi
# NOTE: You can chain up to 8 mcp23s17's together for a total of 16*8 = 128 GPIO Ports !

# PINS A0,A1,A2 determine the address assigned to the device. The diagram above sets the i2c_address
# of the first device to 0x20 and the second to 0x27. To achieve a different address set the pins as follows:
#
# 0x20 = A0(GND)   A1(GND)   A2(GND)
# 0x21 = A0(GND)   A1(GND)   A2(3.3v)
# 0x22 = A0(GND)   A1(3.3v)  A2(GND)
# 0x23 = A0(GND)   A1(3.3v)  A2(3.3v)
# 0x24 = A0(3.3v)  A1(GND)   A2(GND)
# 0x25 = A0(3.3v)  A1(GND)   A2(3.3v)
# 0x26 = A0(3.3v)  A1(3.3v)  A2(GND)
# 0x27 = A0(3.3v)  A1(3.3v)  A2(3.3v)

# Enable two mcp23017's port expanders and set their "i2cAddress's to 0x20 and 0x27. The 
# first mcp23017 with a i2cAddress of 0x20 will start with a pin base of 65. Since the
# mcp23017's have 16 GPIO's, i2cAddress 0 will have pin assignments from 65 - 80. The
# second mcp23017 has a i2cAddress of 0x27 because pins A0,A1, and A2 are all set to high which 
# gives us a binary address of 111 which equals 7. i2cAddress 0x27 pinBase is set to 100 which 
# will give us pin assignments of 100-115 for the 16 pins on the second mcp23s17.
